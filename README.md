### Find the perfect foundation.

## Setup

Ensure you have the [MongoDB binaries](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/) installed on your machine before getting started.
```npm install && npm start```
This should start the express server and also serve up Ionic at http://localhost:8100. The app is meant to be viewed on a mobile phone and has not yet been optimized for larger viewports.
